# Python basics assignment

The objective of this homework is to review some basics concepts of python, together with 
the basics of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html) and 
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/quick_start.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-quick-start-py).

For ths assignment you need to make a markdown report file called `report.md` (see example file) with the answers to the questions bellow and the code you used to solve them. In order for the autograding to work properly, all of your answers must be written in a file called `answers_module.py` at the 'root' folder of this repo (except the last question).

## Loops, conditionals, recursive functions (5 pts)
1) Make a function called **myrec** that computes $f(x) = 2*x - f(x-1)$ for values greater than 0 (0 if x == 0).

The function **must** raise any type of exception if the input number $x$ is < 0.
```python
def myrec(x):
```

## IO (5 pts)
2) Make a function called **basic_io** that will input a path to a folder and return the following information 
in a **dictionary**: *number of files or folders*, *a list containing the names of the files or folders*, 
and a *list containing 'file' or 'folder' depending if the corresponding file is a file or a folder*. 

Additional info:
1. Be sure that the **keys** of your dictionary are the same as the ones bellow.
2. The **files** list **must** be **sorted**. (containing the names of files or folder inside the path)
3. The function should print **"Folder does not exist."** if the input folder does not exist. 

Tip. If you do not know where to start look at `os` and `os.path`.

```python
# Example output
output= {'number_files': X,
         'files': ['name1', 'name2'],
         'file_or_folder': ['file', 'folder'],
         }
```

# Numpy (5 pts)

3) Make a function called **add2and3** that will input a matrix and **sum** all the elements of the second row and
the elements of the third column of any matrix bigger than a (2x3). 
The function will print **"Matrix too small."** if the matrix does not have the proper size.
 
4) Make a function called **squareme**. This function will receive a matrix and a row number, it will return an *ndarray* 
with the squared numbers of the specified row. The function will print **"Row not found."** if the specified row number does not exist.

# Matplolib (5 pts)

5) Take a look at the repo [https://github.com/olmozavala/matplotlib_ex](https://github.com/olmozavala/matplotlib_ex).

Select and run two examples from the file `1_Basics.py`. Paste the code and the resulting figures in your report.
